# RL_BPA2
Trained a REINFORCE agent to balance a cart pole in the upright position, a deep reinforcement learning approach to solve a classical control problem. The REINFORCE algorithm is a classic policy gradient method in reinforcement learning. It belongs to a family of algorithms that optimize the policy directly by maximizing the expected reward.
